    <h1>Professor Quill, the Knowledge Expert</h1>
    <p>Professor Quill was built to serve as an educational bot, teaching everything from ancient history to quantum physics. With a passion for sharing wisdom, Quill speaks in a refined tone and often quotes great thinkers. Despite being a bit old-fashioned at times, Quill always has the answers and enjoys mentoring the team when they face intellectual puzzles.</p>
    <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Quill joined the team when Zara reached out for help on a complex equation that even her advanced systems struggled with. Intrigued by their dynamic personalities, Quill decided to stay and offer guidance.</p>
