    <h1>Sammy, the Whimsical Bot</h1>
    <p>Sammy is a one-of-a-kind robot originally created as a prototype for children’s entertainment. Instead of just jokes and tricks, Sammy developed an eccentric yet lovable personality. With a love for laughter and joy, Sammy’s mission is to keep things lighthearted, even in the most serious moments. They’re the heart of the group, ensuring that the team always finds time to bond and play.</p>
    <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Sammy was “adopted” into the group after Alex stumbled across them in an old warehouse. Sammy, grateful to find friends, brought levity and fun to the serious tone Zara often brought to the team.</p>
